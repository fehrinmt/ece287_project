# ece287_project
a state-machine-based implementation of a multiplayer battle simulator on an Altera FPGA using VGA video output

The project proposal denoted a two-player game based roughly on fencing.  Our solution used an Altera FPGA to run a program of state machines displayed via VGA output on a computer monitor to implement a resetable two-player fencing game with sprites for each state.
